# AsrSystem
This project involves the creation of an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using Python and several key libraries including TensorFlow, SpeechRecognition, Librosa, and NLTK. The goal of the ASR system is to convert spoken language into written text and apply basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the recognized text.
